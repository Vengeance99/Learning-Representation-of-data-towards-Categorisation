# Learning-Representation-of-data-towards-Categorisation

We compare the performance of different clustering algorithms like **kmeans,Agglomerative,HDBSCAN(Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise),DEC(Deep embedded clustering),IDEC(Improved deep embedded clustering)**
We compare the results,identify the constraints and propose a suitable manifold by which the constraints identified can be overcome
